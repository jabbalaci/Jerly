1) What is Earley? What is it good for?
=======================================
For a detailed description about the Earley algorithm
read the following article:

Revesz, Gyorgy E.: Introduction to Formal Languages
McGraw-Hill, 1983. pp. 143--150.

To put it in a nutshell: with this algorithm you can find out
if a word can be generated with a grammar. Example:

grammar:
========
S->S+A
S->A
A->AxB
A->B
B->(s)
B->a

question:
=========
axa+a

The program will give the answer "YES", because the word (question)
can be generated using the rules of the grammar.
